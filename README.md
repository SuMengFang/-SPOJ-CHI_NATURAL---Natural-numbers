# CHI_NATURAL - Natural-numbers(SPOJ)
Provide a solution of CHI_NATURAL on SPOJ in C++.

Notice: 
  1. Before print the result strings, make sure there isn't any '0' head of them. (That made me get "WA" many times.)
  2. Try your best to avoid to call "memset" in loop. That will cost a lot of time to execute, and maybe make you get "TLE".
